Best Logging
Practices Every
Developer
Should Follow

Good logs =
Happy
Debugging!

Keep It
Structured

Tip: Use JSON or key-value pairs
instead of plain text.

Example:
❌ Error: Database connection failed
✅ { "level": "error", "message":
"Database connection failed",
"timestamp": "2025-01-09T12:00:00Z" }

Log Levels
Matter

Tip: Use the right severity levels:

🔹
🔸
⚠
❌
🔥

 DEBUG – For debugging
 INFO – General app flow
 WARNING – Something seems off
 ERROR – Something went wrong
 CRITICAL – Everything is on fire!

Include
Context

Tip: Logs should tell a story! Include
user ID, request ID, session info, etc.

Example:
✅ { "level": "error", "user_id":
123, "request_id": "abc-456",
"message": "Payment failed" }

Don’t Log
Sensitive Data

Tip: Never log passwords, API keys, or PII
(Personal Identifiable Information).
❌ User authenticated: token=abcd1234xyz
✅ User authenticated: token=****

Use Log
Rotation &
Retention 🔄

Tip: Set up log rotation to prevent
disk space overload. Keep only
necessary logs.

Example:
✅

 Configure log retention for 30 days

instead of keeping everything
forever.

Centralized
Logging is a
Game-Changer

Tip: Use tools like ELK Stack, Loki, or
Datadog for easy searching &
analysis.

Final Tip
Test &
Improve

Tip: Treat logging like code—review,
test, and optimize regularly.

biggest
Logging
Mistake?
